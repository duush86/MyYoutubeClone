My Youtube Clone using Brightcove iOS SDK 

Using the guide, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xv1mJvwXok&list=PL0dzCUj1L5JGKdVUtA5xds1zcyzsz7HLj, from Brian Voong 
I created this app that integrates the Brightcove iOS SDK to display and play videos. Videos are pulled from Brightcove 
from Playlist, and displayed on the App on UICollections. 

Most of the credit to Brian for this series. The app was developed on Swift 5.X and iOS 13 as target. 

Thanks.
