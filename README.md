My Youtube Clone using Brightcove SDK 

Using the guide, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xv1mJvwXok&list=PL0dzCUj1L5JGKdVUtA5xds1zcyzsz7HLj, from Brian Voong 
I created this app that integrates the Brightcove SDK to display and play videos. 

Most of the credit to Brian for this series. The app was developed on Swift 5.X and iOS 13 as target.
